**Description**:
Welcome to the Food Image Classifier Transfer Learning project! In this repository, we embark on a journey to develop a state-of-the-art "food image classifier" using the power of transfer learning. Our objective is to leverage the knowledge learned by a pre-trained model, specifically EfficientNetB0, to classify food images into their respective categories.

**Key Phases**:
1. **Feature Extraction**: We start by using a pre-trained model to perform feature extraction on 10% of the dataset. This step involves capturing meaningful image features that will serve as inputs for our neural network.
2. **Neural Network**: These extracted features are then fed into a neural network for classification. This neural network is designed to learn and make predictions based on the extracted features.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: In the second phase, we unlock and fine-tune certain layers of the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model. This fine-tuning process enhances the model's ability to recognize food categories.
4. **Dataset Selection**: We have opted to work with a subset of the 10_food_classes dataset to showcase the power of transfer learning even with limited training data. For testing purposes, the entire dataset is used to demonstrate the model's performance potential.

**Why Explore This Project**:
- Gain hands-on experience with transfer learning, a powerful technique in deep learning.
